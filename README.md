# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a theoretical physicist with a passion for understanding the fundamental laws of the universe. My research journey has taken me through fascinating topics, and I'm currently exploring the exciting field of quantum computing. Here's a bit more about me:

## ðŸ”­ Research Interests
- **Galilean Covariance**: I've delved into the mathematical symmetries that underlie Galilean physics constructed in a theory with covariant tensor formalism. The theory is constructed in a light-cone of a five dimensional Minkowski spacetime 
- **Symplectic Field Theory**: The interplay between geometry and physics has always intrigued me. Symplectic field theory provides a beautiful framework for studying symplectic manifolds and their associated field theories.
- **Wigner Function**: Quantum mechanics wouldn't be complete without the Wigner function! I've spent countless hours pondering its properties and applications.
- **Quantum Computing**: Now, my focus is on harnessing the power of quantum bits (qubits) to solve complex problems efficiently. From quantum algorithms to quantum error correction, I'm all in!

## ðŸŒ± Current Projects
- Building quantum circuits using Qiskit, Cirq, and other quantum programming languages.
- Simulating quantum systems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.
- Collaborating with fellow researchers to explore novel quantum algorithms.

## ðŸ“š Education
- Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics from Unb (University of Brasilia)
- M.Sc. in Theoretical Physics from Unb (University of Brasilia)
- B.Sc. in Physics from UFOB (Federal University of Western Bahia)

## ðŸ’¡ Fun Facts
- My favorite quantum state? Definitely the superposition of curiosity and enthusiasm!
- When not pondering the mysteries of the universe, you'll find me sipping coffee and reading sci-fi novels and phantasy books.
- Love Star Wars and Lord of the Rings universe
- Passionate Gamer and 90's SEGA fan.
- Spouse and father!
